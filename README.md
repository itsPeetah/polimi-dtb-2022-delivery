# Design Thinking for Business 2022

Welcome to the repository for our single-page React website featuring an embedded YouTube video player. This project was created to allow us to finalize and view a spherical video that required extended rendering time, extending beyond the original deadline. Inside, you'll find the source code that integrates the YouTube player seamlessly into a React application, providing a straightforward solution for hosting and displaying our video content.

> If the deployment is not running, please download the source code, `cd`into the directory and run `npm install & npm run build & npm run start`
